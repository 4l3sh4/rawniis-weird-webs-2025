# rawnii's weird web october 2025
⤷ this is my first time participating in a website-making event, but I <i>really</i> love the concept of it!<br><br>

⤷ i really miss the days of the 2000s and 2010s where people would just make their websites with no real purpose other then just to make some laughs.<br><br>

⤷ nowadays, people use the same, generic template for whatever website they want to make. however, I shall not conform to those ideals! i want to make websites that adhere to my artistic tastes, and be proud of what I have created, even if they have no commercial value!<br><br>

⤷ i'm not sure if i'll be able to make a website for all of the days. however, i'll try my very best! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-
